We perform two Rayleigh analyses, one in the right ascension and one in the azimuth angle distributions, that are sensitive to modulations in right ascension and declination, respectively. The largest departure from isotropy appears in the  EeV energy bin, with an amplitude for the first harmonic in right ascension , that has a chance probability , reinforcing the hint previously reported with vertical events alone.}

  journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
  abstract = {We present a detailed study of the large-scale anisotropies of cosmic rays with energies above 4 EeV measured using the Pierre Auger Observatory. For the energy bins [4, 8] EeV and E ≥ 8 EeV, the most significant signal is a dipolar modulation in R.A. at energies above 8 EeV, as previously reported. In this paper we further scrutinize the highest-energy bin by splitting it into three energy ranges. We find that the amplitude of the dipole increases with energy above 4 EeV. The growth can be fitted with a power law with index β = 0.79 ± 0.19. The directions of the dipoles are consistent with an extragalactic origin of these anisotropies at all the energies considered. Additionally, we have estimated the quadrupolar components of the anisotropy: they are not statistically significant. We discuss the results in the context of the predictions from different models for the distribution of ultrahigh-energy sources and cosmic magnetic fields.}
